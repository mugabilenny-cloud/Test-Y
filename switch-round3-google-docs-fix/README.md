# Switch — local-data build with auth, hierarchy search, embedded video, and Google Docs viewer
 
This is the six-original-screen "Switch" UX prototype (Home / My Courses /
Course Detail / Upload / Saved / Viewer), wired to the course-content
spreadsheet instead of a live Supabase project, with local file-backed auth
added on top. No external database, no network calls at runtime except the
YouTube iframe embeds themselves — everything else reads from JSON files
bundled in the repo.
 
## Run it
 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
 
First run: you'll land on the sign-up/login screen (`pages/0_Auth.py`).
Sign up, pick your current semester from the real list the data has, and
you're in for up to 3 days without needing to log in again.
 
## What's here
 
**Local data layer (no external database).** `supabase_client.py`'s live
HTTP/RPC calls are replaced by `tree_store.py` (loads `data/tree.json`,
provides tree/search/grouping) and `local_client.py` (same function names
and shapes `supabase_client.py` had, so every page's import line was the
only required change versus the original prototype).
 
**Local auth (no external database, no plaintext passwords).** `local_auth.py`
— PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with a random per-user salt; the raw password is never
written to disk. Session tokens (not passwords) persist across reloads via
`st.query_params`, file-backed in `data/sessions.json` with a 3-day expiry.
A valid session skips straight to Home with no re-prompt; an expired or
missing one routes to `pages/0_Auth.py`.
 
**Hierarchy-aware search.** `TreeStore.search()` tags node hits with which
tree level matched (faculty/department/course_unit/etc.) and link hits with
whether the query matched a title or a url, instead of one flat undifferentiated
list. `local_client.search_courses()` surfaces both to the search box.
 
**Per-topic grouping in Course Detail.** Every row in `repo_5.xlsx` ends its
path in the literal segment `"Class"`, so a course unit's 14+ links (for
Pathophysiology, for example) all share one tree node — see the caveat
below. `TreeStore.links_for_node_grouped()` splits them back into their real
topics (Epilepsy 2, Meningitis, Stroke, etc.) using each link's own `title`
field, and Course Detail renders a labeled section per topic instead of one
flat pile of cards.
 
**Red-coded inline YouTube embeds.** `tree_store.youtube_video_id()` extracts
the video id from a youtube url; `ui_components.youtube_embed()` renders an
actual playable iframe; `video_resource_card()` wraps that in a styled card
with a red (`#DC2626`) type chip. Reachable from Course Detail, Saved, Home's
search results, and the Viewer page.

**Google Docs inline viewer fix.** `drive_notes` and `drive_questions` links
are recognized as Google Docs/Drive resources. `tree_store.google_doc_embed_url()`
converts supported Google Docs/Drive URL forms to Google's preview endpoint,
and `pages/6_Viewer.py` renders that endpoint with Streamlit's iframe component
instead of the old generic placeholder. The original source URL remains stored
unchanged for normal link access. This also avoids emitting the stray `</div>`
text that can appear when the placeholder HTML is used.
 
**Per-user history and saved items.** `local_history.py` and `local_saved.py`
— file-backed, so a save or a "recently opened" entry survives a closed tab
within your 3-day session, not just the current browser tab.
 
## The data
 
`data/tree.json` was generated from `repo_5.xlsx` by `tools/import_content.py`.
Re-run it if the spreadsheet changes:
 
```bash
python tools/import_content.py path/to/repo_5.xlsx
```
 
Current import: **24 nodes, 157 links** (30 of them YouTube videos with
real, working urls).
 
### Two things worth knowing about the source data — not bugs, don't "fix" these
 
1. Every path in `repo_5.xlsx` ends in the literal segment `"Class"` rather
   than a per-topic name — this is why the title-based grouping above exists
   at all. The fix is at the link-grouping level (already built), not by
   trying to split `"Class"` into separate tree nodes.
2. The source file has two slightly different department-name spellings
   under Health Sciences (`"BMS   0000"` with extra internal spaces, and
   plain `"BMS"`) that produce two separate tree nodes rather than merging.
   This may reflect a real distinction in the source data — don't silently
   merge these.
 
## What's intentionally NOT here
 
- **Ads / "What's New on Campus" feed** — no ads table exists locally, so
  `fetch_feed()` returns empty and that section stays hidden.
- **Student uploads / crowdsourcing** — the Upload screen is still a
  placeholder form; content is added by re-running the importer.
- **Non-Google inline preview** — PDFs/slides and other non-Google resources
  still show the existing placeholder. Google Docs/Drive note/question links
  now use the inline Google preview fix described above.
- **A password-change or account-settings screen** — sign-out exists (top
  right of Home); nothing else account-related does yet.
 
## Project layout
 
```
app.py                  entry point — auth gate, routes to Home or sign-in
local_auth.py           local hash+salt auth, 3-day sessions (data/users.json,
                         data/sessions.json)
local_history.py        per-user "recently opened" (data/history.json)
local_saved.py          per-user saved/bookmarked items (data/saved.json)
ui_components.py        shared widgets — cards, tiles, nav, youtube embeds
local_client.py         drop-in for supabase_client.py — same functions,
                         backed by tree_store.py instead of HTTP
tree_store.py           loads data/tree.json, tree-walk + search + grouping
pages/
  0_Auth.py             sign-up / login
  1_Home.py             search, active-semester tiles, recent history, feed

  3_Course_Detail.py    topic-grouped resources, video embeds
  4_Upload.py
